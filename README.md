# R-Activity-Logger
My professor had this issue where people were opening the same file on the computer at the same time, and saving over eachother's work

This was to rectify that although I never got it completely off the ground. 

In the future I should have it not completely record every coming and going in a repository but only 
specified files, the groundwork of recording which lines get changed should be the same.
